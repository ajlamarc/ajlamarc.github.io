The best diet is one you will follow.  A proper diet will cover all bases for vitamins / minerals.  Therefore, I reserve supplementation for compounds not easily found in food.

1. [Sulphoraphane](https://www.broq.life/).  Learn about the science [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4YVJ4aRfg&ab_channel=FoundMyFitness).
2. [NMN](https://novoslabs.com/product/novos-boost/).  Learn about the science [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB9fby497HE&ab_channel=HweePengLoo).
3. Vitamin D3.  (Or get enough sun exposure.)
4. Fish oil.  (Or eat enough fish.)

I will explain my daily diet in a future post.
