Quality of life is the result of a series of decisions.  Avoid as many wrong decisions as possible.

The three most critical decisions are:

<ol>
    <li>Where you live (network, opportunities)</li>
    <li>What you do (job or career)</li>
    <li>Who you’re with (relationship)</li>
</ol>

You start your 20s with no answers.  Lacking experience, you make wrong decisions.

Wrong decisions will happen.  Recognize and reverse them immediately.  Every wrong decision is your teacher.

Right decisions, executed poorly, will also cause failure.  This is your opportunity to reinvent yourself.

Right decisions and right execution: winner!

Consider first what would be a right answer to those three questions.  Next, work on execution, being mindful of strengths and weaknesses.  After the next failure event, refine the decision-making and execution processes.

I will explain the stages of this process in future posts.
