Avoid as many wrong decisions as possible.</p> <p>The three most critical decisions are:</p> <ol> <li>Where you live (network, opportunities)</li> <li>What you do (job or career)</li> <li>Who you’re with (relationship)</li> </ol> <p>You start your 20s with no answers. Lacking experience, you make wrong decisions.</p> <p>Wrong decisions will happen. Recognize and reverse them immediately. Every wrong decision is your teacher.</p> <p>Right decisions, executed poorly, will also cause failure. This is your opportunity to reinvent yourself.</p> <p>Right decisions and right execution: winner!</p> <p>Consider first what would be a right answer to those three questions. Next, work on execution, being mindful of strengths and weaknesses. After the next failure event, refine the decision-making and execution processes.</p> <hr/> <p>I will explain the stages of this process in future posts.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thinking"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[and why this matters]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">my supplements</title><link href="https://ajlamarc.github.io/blog/2022/supplements/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="my supplements"/><published>2022-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://ajlamarc.github.io/blog/2022/supplements</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ajlamarc.github.io/blog/2022/supplements/"><![CDATA[<p>The best diet is one you will follow.
